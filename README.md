# Project Details

The Titanic dataset is a well known dataset that I have taken from Kaggle and performed feature engineering on and then trained using models stacking.

# Learning 
Stacking models gave a higher accuracy (obviously). 


If you wish to use the notebook, make sure the dataset is present in a Input Folder in the same directory as the notebook.
